# Graph Theory Project 
# By Andrew Carroll


<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> Final Year Student studying Software Development in GMIT, the following README is the documentation for the module <b> Graph Theory </b> taught in the final year of the level 7 programme of Computing & Software Development by lecturer Ian Mcloughlin. Graph Theory is used through out computation and the following project was assigned to demonstrate this.</p>

<h2> Project Brief </h2>
<p> You are required to design and prototype a Neo4j database for use
in a timetabling system for a third level institute like GMIT. The database
should store information about student groups, classrooms, lecturers, and
work hours â€“ just like the currently used timetabling system at GMIT </p>

<h2> What is a Graph Database? </h2> 
<p> This is a database that stores data using graph structures and logical queries.  Graph databases are based on graph theory and use nodes & edges (relationships). The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly. When trying to retrieve data from a graph database it needs a query language an example of this would be <b> Cypher </b>.   </p>

<h2> Cypher </h2> 
<p> a very simple and powerful graph query language that was developed by Neo Technology for its graph database <b> Neo4j </b> it is an SQL-Inspired language for describing patterns in graphs visually using an ascii-art syntax. </p>

<h2> Neo4j </h2> 
<p> A software program developed by Neo Technology to deal with the management system of graph databases. according to db-engines.com Neo4j it is described as the most popular graph database system.The Neo4j Software is  achieved in Java and accessible from software written in other languages using the Cypher Query Language. To start using the  Neo4j software visit https://neo4j.com/download/ and select the download for the community edition for Individuals. After the download and installation process you can choose your password and begin working with Neo4j to build databases.  </p>
