<h1> Graph Theory Project By Andrew Carroll </h1>


<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> Final Year Student studying Software Development in GMIT, the following README is the documentation for the module <b> Graph Theory </b> taught in the final year of the level 7 programme of Computing & Software Development by lecturer Ian Mcloughlin. Graph Theory is used through out computation and the following project was assigned to demonstrate this.</p>

<h2> Project Brief </h2>
<p> You are required to design and prototype a Neo4j database for use
in a timetabling system for a third level institute like GMIT. The database
should store information about student groups, classrooms, lecturers, and
work hours â€“ just like the currently used timetabling system at GMIT </p>

<h2> What is a Graph Database? </h2> 
<p> This is a database that stores data using graph structures and logical queries.  Graph databases are based on graph theory and use nodes & edges (relationships). The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly. When trying to retrieve data from a graph database it needs a query language an example of this would be <b> Cypher </b>.   </p>

<h2> Cypher </h2> 
<p> a very simple and powerful graph query language that was developed by Neo Technology for its graph database <b> Neo4j </b> it is an SQL-Inspired language for describing patterns in graphs visually using an ascii-art syntax. </p>
